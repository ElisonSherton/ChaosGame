# Chaos Game
A visual testament of order emerging out of chaos

In this Numberphile video, Ben Sparks depicted how apparently chaotic patterns underly the creation of a uniquely ordered structure viz. The Sierpinski Triangle.

Watch him explain the entire process over here:

In this model, one has to start with three non-collinear points and a fourth random point which is in the same plane as these three points. The motion of this fourth point is dictated by the outcome of a random event like the rolling an unbiased die.

In the video, Ben makes the fourth point move to the half it's distance from first point if the outcome of the rolling of die event is 1 or 2. He moves it to half it's distance from the second point if the coutcome of the rolling event is 3 or 4 and to half it's distance from the third point otherwise. This simple set of rules which is highly probabilistic in nature and seemingly random creates something which is highly ordered and I mean it literally.

The Sierpinski Triangle is a fractal which is essentially self similar and can be generated in a systematic way recursively. This is the beauty of mathematics which thanks to Processing and Daniel Shiffman, I could see for myself visually. Enjoy this Processing Code to make your own Sierpinski Triangle
